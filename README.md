# CPP---Module---00
This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming!

## Description
In this initial series of exercises, we'll cover the basic syntax of C++: explore namespaces, dive into classes, and get familiar with member functions along with a few other key concepts.

# C++ Project Guidelines

## 1. Compilation
- Compile your code with `c++` and the flags `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Werror`:
- Your code must still compile if you add the flag `-std=c++98`:

## 2. Formatting and Naming Conventions
- The exercise directories must be named as follows: `ex00`, `ex01`, ..., `exn`:

- Name your files, classes, functions, member functions, and attributes according to the guidelines

- Write class names in **UpperCamelCase** format

- Files containing class code must be named according to the class name:
  - If you have a class named `BrickWall`, the corresponding files should be `BrickWall.hpp` (or `.h` for the header) and `BrickWall.cpp` for the implementation.

- Unless otherwise specified, all output messages must end with a newline character and be displayed to the standard output

- No specific coding style is enforced (unlike **Norminette** in C)

## 3. Allowed/Forbidden
- **You are not coding in C anymore; it’s time for C++**:
  - You must use C++ features instead of sticking to what you already know from C.

- You can use almost everything from the **C++ Standard Library**:
  - It’s allowed to use the C++ Standard Library (e.g., strings, streams, etc.).

- **External libraries are not allowed**:
  - You cannot use external libraries outside of the C++ Standard Library. Specifically, **C++11** (and later versions) and **Boost libraries** are forbidden.

- The following functions are forbidden: `*printf()`, `*alloc()`, and `free()`

## 4. C++ Concepts
- **Namespaces, classes, member functions, input/output streams (stdio), initialization lists, static, const, and other basic C++ concepts**:

- The keywords `using namespace <namespace_name>` and `friend` are forbidden:
  - You cannot use `using namespace` to avoid naming conflicts, nor can you use `friend` to gain direct access to private members of a class.

- You can only use the **STL** (Standard Template Library) in **modules 08 and 09**:
  - Until modules 08 and 09, you are **not allowed** to use containers like `vector`, `list`, `map`, or algorithms included in the `<algorithm>` header. If you use them before these modules, you will receive a grade of **-42**.

## 5. Design Requirements
- **Memory leaks occur in C++ too**:
  - When you allocate memory using `new`, you must properly deallocate it (using `delete`) to avoid memory leaks.

- From **module 02 to module 09**, your classes must follow the **Orthodox Canonical Form**:
  - This means your classes must implement the following "big four" methods: a default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor.

- **Placing function implementations in a header file** (except for templates) will result in a score of 0 for the exercise:
  - Functions must be implemented in `.cpp` files, not in header (`.hpp`) files unless they're template functions.

- Each header must be usable independently of others:
  - Your `.hpp` files must include all necessary dependencies and use include guards (or `#pragma once`) to avoid double inclusions. If an include guard is missing, the exercise will receive a grade of 0.
